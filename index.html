                     <h1>KPIs Formulas Used</h1>
                      <p><h4>Churn Rate:</h4> <p> Calculates the ratio of churned customers to the total number of customers, using the CALCULATE function with COUNTROWS and FILTER to count the rows in the 'Churn' table where the churn status is "Yes."</p>

                      <p><h4>Average Customer Lifespan:</h4><p> Calculates the average duration of the customer relationship for churned customers, using the DIVIDE function with CALCULATE, SUM, and FILTER to calculate the sum of 'tenure' for churned customers and then divide it by the total number of customers.</p>
                      
                      <p><h4>Customer Lifetime Value (CLV):</h4><p>  Calculates the customer lifetime value by dividing the total revenue by the total number of customers and multiplying it by the average customer lifespan. It uses CALCULATE, SUM, FILTER, and DIVIDE functions to calculate the sum of 'tenure' for churned customers, divide it by the total number of customers, and then multiply it by the total revenue.</p>
                     
                      <p><h4>Monthly Recurring Revenue</h4><p> Calculates the Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) by summing the 'MonthlyCharges' column for each row in the 'Churn' table, using the SUMX function. It iterates over each row in the table and adds up the monthly charges for all customers.</p>

                      <p><h4>Non Churn Cust:</h4><p>  Calculates the count of non-churn customers using the <b>CALCULATE</b> function with <b>FILTER</b> to count the rows in the 'Churn' table where the churn status is "No."</p>

                      <p><h4>Active Months:</h4><p>  Calculates the total number of months that non-churn customers have been active using the CALCULATE function with SUM and FILTER to calculate the sum of 'tenure' for non-churn customers.</p>
                      
                      <p><h4>Active Customers:</h4> <p> Calculates the count of active customers using the COUNTROWS function with FILTER to count the rows in the 'Churn' table where the churn status is "No."</p>
                      
                      <p><h4>Churn Cust:</h4><p>  Calculates the count of churned customers using the CALCULATE function with FILTER to count the rows in the 'Churn' table where the churn status is "Yes."</p>
                      
                      <p><h4>Customer Retention Rate:</h4><p>  Calculates the customer retention rate by subtracting the count of lost customers from the total number of customers and then dividing it by the total number of customers.</p>
